Wish Seekers of the Storm had more loop variants so I tried my hand at it.

Variants will have some minor gameplay changes and enemy additions, if all players have the mod. (Should Auto-Detect)
  
No idea how this mod interacts with Stage Aesthetics or Cooler Stages.
 

## Weather changes in-game :

Reformed Altar & Prime Meridian will have their green leaves replaced with the pink-reddish ones from Golden Dieback during loops, since they're directly connected.

### Inspirations :
```
- Titanic Plains	: Version made for old trailers.
- Siphoned Forest	: Aurora Borealis are cool, the one it already has was barley visible.  
- Abandoned Aqueduct	: Unused Tar River, Passage of time overfilling it.
- Wetland Aspect	: Internal name FoggySwamp, Passage of time overfilling it.
- Aphelian Sanctuary	: Eclipsing the Sun, ominous Lunar glow.
- Scorched Acres	: Unused Eclipse Weather. (they just tested it here for the menu for some reason)
- Sulfur Pools		: Real Blue "Lava" Volcanos. 
- Sundered Grove	: Spring/Autumn (copying Golden Dieback)
---
- Reformed Altar	: Directly connected to Treeborn, so should be Golden Dieback on loop. More gold feeling.
- Abyssal Depths	: Red Plane color-scheme
- Helminth Hatchery	: Molten Gold
 ```

  <summary>Enemy additions (if enabled)</summary>
  
- Siphoned Forest : Greater Wisp  
- Abandoned Aqueduct : Lunar Exploders. Loop: Lunar Golems, Lunar Wisps
- Scorched Acres : Childs
- Abyssal Depths : Void Reaver, Void Barnacle. Loop: Void Jailer, Void Devestator
- Sundered Grove : Geep, Gip
- Helminth Hatchery : Halcyonite

Basically all of these can fit the "Passage of Time" theme.\
Even the more interesting changes such as Blue Lava Sulfur Pools, the background Volcano erupting as an idea for that.

If you're reporting a bug that isn't something obvious include the log file.

This mod does not add these variants as "new stages" or new spawn pools for them. Instead simply editing the weather/pools of existing ones.

Stage Aesthetic compatibility is not handled by me.

Not entirely happy with how some turned out but some are great.
