v1.5.0
Split loop variant config into it's mod.
Clients can now roll for Variants if the Host does not have the mod.

v1.4.2
Fixed for False Son patch.

v1.3.2 - Attempt at fixing problem with how r2dmodman keeps folder structures
v1.3.1 - Attempt at fixing problem with how r2dmodman keeps folder structures
v1.3.0
Added Loop Weather for Reformed Altar. (Golden Dieback leaves, yellow vibe)
Added Loop Change to Prime Meridian. (Golden Dieback leaves)
-Since Treeborn is very visible in both these stages, it makes sense to change it to Golden Dieback on loops.

Added Risk of Options support.
Added more Aquaducts to Tar filled Aquaduct
Lowered Tar debuff duration by 1s.
Made mod translatable.
Took AssetBundle out of .dll.
Fixed Sulfur Pods Helfire using wrong config.
Fixed wrong Disturbed Impact spawn pool having Cleansing Pools removed.


v1.2.3
Fixed an issue with Abyssal Variant rocks being more red than intended.
Removed Cleansing Pool and Wild Printer from Stage 1 Disturbed Impact

v1.2.2
Tied applying weather directly to recieving the information for clients.
(Might mean they see the normal version for a couple frames when loading weirdly)
(But should mean they never get out of sync)

Added a config to disable Helfire Sulfur Pods on Sulfur Variant.
Made Moss patches less slimy in Sundered Variant

v1.2.1
Made textures added by mod able to scale down. (Optimization)
(Apparently something I needed to add manually and this optimization is missing from most textures I ever added)

Matched Sunset Plains Sun rotation more to Trailer Plains rotation
Increased visibility on Forest, reduced shadow strength on Plains.
Made new Abyssal Depths ground less noisy.
Reduced light amount in Sulfur Pools variant. (Potentially optimization)(Config to reduce further)
Reduced fruit amount in Sundered Grove variant.  (Potentially optimization)
Grove Variant should load faster.

Config to make variants chance based on Loop2+ (Disabled by default)
(ie: You want guaranteed variants Loop 1 but not on Loop 2,3,4, because you'd see the default variants less if most your runs do multiple loops)


v1.2.0
Added loop weather for Sundered Grove (Orange, Autumn-y, has Fruit from Golden Dieback)
Added loop weather for Sulfur Pools (Blue Smoke)

Adjusted fog on Abyssal and Helminth variant slightly.
Increased visibility on Wetland and Scorched variant slightly.
Fixed Fruit in Golden Dieback, not working.


v1.1.0
Added loop weather for Wetlands Aspect (Foggy, Rainy, More Water)

Hopefully increased consistency of syncing weathers in multiplayer.
Fixed Golden Dieback not appearing pre loop if enabled.
Fixed stage names still changing if variant disabled.
If stage order is random (Artifact of Wander), 50/50 chance to use the loop or preloop chance.

-Stage 1 Disturbed Impact will no longer have.
--Elder Lemurian
-Stage 1 Viscious Falls will no longer have.
--Elder Lemurians
