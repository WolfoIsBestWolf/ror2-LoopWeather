Adds config to allow Loop Variants to occur pre-loop.

Or for unLooped variants to happen on Loops.



#
Makes some enemies properly loop exclusive on the Stage 1 Variants so they can better fit a stage 1 role.

Viscious Falls :
- Imp Overlord & Grovetender
- Elder Lemurian & Void Reaver

Disturbed Impact :
- Grovetender
- Pre-Loop: Scales as 280 credits with flat -20 for Guaranteed Large Chest
- - Normally has 310 credits, would be too much for a Stage 1.
